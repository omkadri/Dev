Garbage Collection:
- Default constructors should always initialize member variables.


Constructors
- Default constructor vs Paramaterized Constructors

Memory allocation
- New is an operator that allocates memory to the Heap
- Every New needs to have a corresponding delete to ensure proper memory allocation

Stings and Char
- Every string is an array of char variables plus a null terminator
- a char represents 1 byte
- when allocating a string in memory, you must always add 1 extra byte to account for the null terminator

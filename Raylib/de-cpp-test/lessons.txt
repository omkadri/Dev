Garbage Collection:
- Default constructors should always initialize member variables.


Constructors
- Default constructor vs Paramaterized Constructors

Memory allocation
- Member variables should always be initialized to prevent unpredictable behaviour 
- New is an operator that allocates memory to the Heap
- Every New needs to have a corresponding delete to ensure proper memory allocation
- Arrays must be deleted with 'delete[]' instead of 'delete'. The reason for this is because 'delete' will not know how much memory is allocated and will lead to Undefined behaviour.
- Buffer Overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space for a variable.

Stings and Char
- Every string is an array of char variables plus a null terminator
- a char represents 1 byte
- when allocating a string in memory, you must always add 1 extra byte to account for the null terminator

===[ Introduction ]============================================================

The enclosed code is some basic code for managing path-node and Power-Up
objects in a 3D Map. A very simple power-up hierarchy is in place but is
far from complete.

As I'm sure you know, path-nodes are used by AI agents to navigate through a
map. A typical "real" map would contain upwards of a thousand PathNodes, but
we've included a simple graph of 8 nodes. A pictoral representation of the
graph is shown in Graph.png and the data has been entered in Main.cpp.

The test has been broken up into two small parts. The entire thing should
take no-more than a few hours (an evening, tops), but take your time. Please
keep a rough idea of how long you spent at it, though -- if you spent more
time and did cooler stuff, that's all good.

You may modify the code as you see fit, but we are expecting that you write 
code that compiles and runs; we will be running your code against a test 
harness to check for correctness. Signatures of the following functions/methods
should remain in their original form:
- FindPowerUp (Main.cpp)
- LinkNodes (Main.cpp)
- PathNode::GetName (PathNode.h)
- PathNode::AddPowerUp (PathNode.h)
- PathNode::AddLink (PathNode.h)

Note: Node5 and Node7 having the same position is intentional (Main.cpp),
please keep it this way.

===[ Part 1 ]==================================================================

Find as many bugs with the existing code as you can. There are several subtle
but common errors throughout the code. It compiles, and runs, but would not
stand up to production use.

For bonus marks, add a few statements here-and-there to make the code more 
quick to detect errors.

You can impose any reasonable restrictions on how the functions can be used
and abused. Halting the program on error illegal input is acceptable in most
cases, but use your judgement for deciding when it isn't appropriate.

===[ Part 2 ]==================================================================

Implement the "findPowerUp" function sketched out in Main.cpp. It is to find a
path through the graph of PathNodes to the nearest PowerUp of the given mType.
Return NULL for no-path, or return an allocated array containing the path as
shown in the function skeleton. We are looking for the shortest path to a 
matching powerup -- ie. the path where the sum of the edge weights is 
minimized, where an edge weight is the distance between connected vertexes.

Please briefly describe the algorithm you chose and why you chose it in a
comment block at the top of the function. You will be evaluated on correctness,
efficiency from a performance and memory perspective, as well as general code
structure and understandability. 
Please assume that your code may be called from a multi-threaded environment
(more than 1 search query at the same time).
